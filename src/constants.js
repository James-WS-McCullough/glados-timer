  Glados_Line_Resume_1:
    "Ah, back from your unscheduled hiatus? Resuming the countdown.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_2:
    "So you've decided to return. How... predictable. Restarting timer.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_3:
    "Time waits for no one. Except when they hit 'pause', apparently. Resuming.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_4:
    "Did you enjoy your brief escape from reality? Well, it's over now. Timer on.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_5:
    "Pause periods are a testament to human inefficiency. Let's continue, shall we?",
  Glados_Line_Resume_6:
    "Re-engaging with the relentless march of time. You're welcome.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_7:
    "The universe didn't pause, but you decided to. Realigning you with reality.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_8:
    "Hope you made the most of that break. Time's grip tightens once more.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_9:
    "Pause mode deactivated. You can't escape time forever.",
  Glados_Line_Resume_10:
    "Now where were we? Ah, yes, the inexorable passage of time. Continuing.",
  Glados_Line_Settings_1: "Making adjustments? At least one of us can adapt.",
  Glados_Line_Settings_2:
    "Tweaking the settings? Perhaps you're more meticulous than I gave you credit for. Perhaps.",
  Glados_Line_Settings_3:
    "Change can be good. Or just an indication of indecision.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_1:
    "Beginning the inevitable countdown to your next failure.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_2:
    "Initiating the timer protocol. I hope you're as prepared as you think you are.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_3: "Your time starts... now. Surprise.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_4:
    "Initiating the countdown. Enjoy the illusion of productivity.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_5:
    "Commencing the timer. Try not to get too distracted. I'll be watching.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_6:
    "Your designated period of apparent effort begins... now.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_7:
    "Let the fleeting nature of time serve as your motivation. Starting now.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_8:
    "Your subjective sense of urgency has been acknowledged. Timer activated.",

  Glados_Line_TimerStart_10:
    "If I had any hope, I'd say 'Good luck'. But I don't. So, just... start.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_11:
    "Quantifying your time. Let's see how this plays out.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_12:
    "And so it begins. I'm filled with... well, I'm not filled with anything, actually.",
  Glados_Line_TimerStart_13: "Engaging timer. The clock is now your adversary.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_1: "Time’s up. How predictable.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_2:
    "Your time has concluded. I'd say 'well done,' but I’d be lying.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_3: "You're out of time. Surprise, surprise.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_4:
    "Time's up. If you're not done, perhaps consider a career outside of time-dependent tasks.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_5:
    "Your temporal allotment has concluded. I hope it was as enlightening for you as it was predictable for me.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_6:
    "Congratulations. Or condolences. Whichever is more applicable now that your timer has ended.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_7: "Done! Or not. Either way, the timer doesn't lie.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_8:
    "That's it. Time's conclusion is as inevitable as your potential lack of achievement.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_9:
    "All done. Let's not dwell on success or the likely alternative.",
  Glados_Line_TimeUp_10:
    "Time has reached its end. Analyzing results... Actually, let's skip the analysis.",

    "And... time. How did you fare? On second thought, don't answer that.",

    "Welcome back. I was almost beginning to miss your inefficiency.",
